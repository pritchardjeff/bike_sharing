Last summer a friend and I went to New York and realized our trip was great due to us being able to bike everywhere. The bikes we used were rentals through a bikesharing service. We would like to start a similar business where we live and want to figure out how the bikeshare business works in NYC and determine if we can replicate the business model in our hometown.

The analysis is done in tableau and the visualizations will be explained in the results section of our analysis.

#### Part 2: Ending Locations
