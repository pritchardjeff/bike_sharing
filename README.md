## Overview of the analysis

[link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jeff.pritchard#!/vizhome/BikesharingDashboard/Story1)

Last summer a friend and I went to New York and realized our trip was great due to us being able to bike everywhere. The bikes we used were rentals through a bike sharing service. We would like to start a similar business where we live and want to figure out how the bikeshare business works in NYC and determine if we can replicate the business model in our hometown.

The analysis is done in tableau and the visualizations will be explained in the results section of our analysis.

### Results

#### Part 1: Starting Locations

The bulk of the starting locations are concentrated around Manhattan, so we will need to determine the most density populated part of our home town in order to mirror similar results.

#### Part 2: Ending Locations

The ending locations and the starting locations are similar density-wise. This leads us to believe that we may a high population of commuters in the city.

#### Part 3: Checkout times for Users

![Part_3](https://github.com/pritchardjeff/bike_sharing/blob/main/Part_3.png)

The trip duration peaked between the 3rd and 8th hours of the day.

#### Part 4

The number of male riders significantly outnumber the female riders.

#### Part 5

During the work week, many users seem to be active during commutes.

On the weekends, the usage is more evenly distributed throughout the day.

#### Part 6

Men seem to be much more active commuters than women. 

We will need to determine the number of potential commuters in our hometown to determine for this to be successful.

#### Part 7

Most of the rides are coming from male subscribers.

### Summary

Overall, it looks like we will need to determine how commutable our target areas will be, how much tourism we have in our city, and how best to target male subscribers in order to achieve a similar volume and business mix to our competitors in New York.

The next two visualizations:

1) One that segments the users by age, gender, usertype, and weekday. It will be helpful to determine which age groups are commuting so we can see if we have the population base in our hometown to be able to accommodate similar results.
2) One that digs deeper into the non-subscriber data and determines the difference in time between their first and last ride so we can see what percentage of rides comes from tourists. This will assist with determining if our hometown has enough tourism to create a similar amount of revenue.
